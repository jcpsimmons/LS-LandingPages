              From the beginning of my journey here at Living Spaces, I have
              strived to do my best in delivering quality service and exhibiting
              a customer-friendly attitude. There were moments were this was a
              challenge, but this company's mission is to provide the best
              possible service to each guest with whom
              <span class="read_more_dot">...</span
              ><span class="read_more_btn">Read More</span
              ><span class="read_more_hidden">
                we come in contact. This results in customer loyalty. I have
                enjoyed my journey with Living Spaces, and I indeed feel it is a
                great company to work for. It is true that if you work hard and
                apply yourself, moving up in the company is a real and
                attainable opportunity. I was thrilled to learn that I was
                chosen as a Volunteer with Furnishing Hope. I tell you, until
                you have experience this rewarding opportunity, words cannot
                express the emotions that go along with volunteering for such an
                organization. It was exciting to furnish and decorate for this
                young veteran. Most of all, the look on her face when she came
                into her apartment was, as they say, "a Kodak moment." The
                emotions that swell up inside is something I will never forget.
                It is a thrill to work for a company that gives back and
                provides assistance in times of disaster. Do I recommend Living
                Spaces as a great place to work? Of course I do!!<span

              I can’t say enough about how great it has been working for Living
              Spaces. I have grown so much personally and professionally.
              Everyone here works together and is open to listening to all

                company that continues to give back to communities. It was a
                very rewarding experience as I took part in one of our programs.
                I was able to help refurnish a veteran’s home. I look forward to
                getting involved in more events like these and I am so glad I

              When I joined the Living Spaces family, we had only two stores. We
              all worked together to get the job done: answering phones,
              scheduling deliveries, making survey calls Monday through Friday.
              Weekends working on the sales floor, writing up orders or filling
              in as a cashier to get those orders processed. I thought nothing

                later, we have 22 stores and several distribution centers and
                warehouses, as well as competitive pay and benefits. With this
