        the items will ship via UPS (Ground or Freight). A separate tracking
        number will be provided by UPS, but you may track your entire order
        using the Living Spaces’ <a href="/track-delivery">tracking tool</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="bold">Is Parcel Shipping free?</p>
      <p>
        Yes. Enjoy free Parcel Shipping nationwide for all our rugs, pillows,
        wall art, and other home accessories. No minimum amount is required.
      </p>
      <p class="bold">May I request Parcel Shipping?</p>
      <p>
        No need to request it. Items available for Parcel Shipping will
        automatically be setup for Parcel Shipping when you checkout.
