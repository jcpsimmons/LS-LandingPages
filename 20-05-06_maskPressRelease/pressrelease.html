        Living Spaces Turns Manufacturing Facility into Temporary COVID-19 Mask
        Creation Zone

        Furniture retailer has donated 85K+ masks to medical community, sells

      <p>
        LA MIRADA, Calif., May 4, 2020 – California-based furniture retailer,
        <a href="/">Living Spaces</a>, today announced its expansion of mask
        production initiatives to support those impacted by COVID-19. The
        national furniture retailer has been using its large manufacturing
        facility to create and donate non-clinical face masks amid shortages in
        its local communities. The masks have been designed and donated to local
        health organizations to support various ancillary hospital needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s more, Living Spaces also announced its
        <a href="/departments/face-masks">“Buy One Mask, Give One Mask,”</a>
        initiative where non-clinical masks will be available for purchase
        online, and Living Spaces will match each purchase with a donation to
        local hospitals. Beginning today, masks with varying design options will
        be available for limited purchase through the Living Spaces website.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We have the team, the tools, the space, and the materials to contribute
        to this cause, so for us, donating our staff’s time and our resources
        was the right thing to do,” said Grover Geiselman, CEO of Living Spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        The manufacturing team, who normally produce sofas and sectionals, has
        been spending 100% of their time answering the community’s call for
        increased mask production and putting furniture production temporarily
        on hold. Prior to the launch of the “Buy One Mask, Give One Mask”
        initiative, Living Spaces donated over 60,000 masks to Kaiser
        Permanente, 5,000 went to Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, 15,000 to
        Cedars-Sinai and 5,000 to Keck Medicine of USC. The team is following
        appropriate guidelines for creating protective gear, set in place by
        Kaiser Permanente and <a href="https://laprotects.org/">LA Protects</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        “At Living Spaces, we are deeply committed to our employees, clients and
        the communities we serve with health and safety always at the
        forefront,” said Geiselman. “We are grateful to the heroic men and women
        who are risking their lives during this global pandemic and will
        continue to show our support in any way we can.” For more information
