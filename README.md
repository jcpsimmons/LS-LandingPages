# LS-LandingPages
Living Spaces landing page code repository

## Structure

New landing pages are kept root-level in the repo in their own folder. Folder titling should be formatted as such `yy-mm-dd_EVENTNAME`

Once landing pages are out of support, they are moved to the `old/` directory. It's good to keep these since certain design elements repeat yearly and code can be reused.
