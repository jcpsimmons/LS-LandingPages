    <p>Standard, data and Internet access rates may apply if you access the Website, and you are solely responsible for
        any such charges. Automated entries are prohibited and any use of automated devices will cause disqualification.
        Use of email addresses from disposable or temporary email address services, or email forwarding services, is
        prohibited and any attempt to enter using such an email address will be blocked. Only entries submitted with
        valid email addresses are eligible. Should multiple users of the same email account enter the Promotion and a
        dispute thereafter arise regarding the identity of the entrant, the authorized account holder of said email
        account at the time of entry will be considered the entrant, provided they are otherwise eligible to enter the
        Promotion. “Authorized account holder” is defined as the natural person who is assigned an email address by an
        Internet access provider, on-line service provider or other organization which is responsible for assigning
        email addresses or the domain associated with the submitted email address. Sponsor reserves the right at its
        sole discretion to disqualify any individual who tampers with the entry process.

    <p>Information provided in connection with the Promotion will be used as set forth herein and in Sponsor’s Privacy
        Policy, available at <a href="/company/privacy-policy">www.livingspaces.com/company/privacy-policy</a>. If you
        are selected as a winner, your information may also be included in a publicly-available winners’ list.</p>

    <p><b>3. WINNER SELECTION</b></p>
    <p>On the second Monday of each month as specified above, there will be one (1) random drawing from among all
        eligible entries received by Sponsor. Odds of winning depend on the number of eligible entries received.
        Potential winners will be notified by email within five (5) business days of each drawing. The potential winner
        is subject to verification, including verification of age and address, and must provide upon request all
        additional affidavits of eligibility and releases and completed tax identification form(s). If any potential
        winner fails to respond to the prize notification message within ten (10) days and/or fails to provide any
        requested information and documents; if prize correspondence or prize is returned as non-deliverable; or if a
        potential winner is found not to be eligible or not in compliance with these Official Rules, prize will be
        forfeited and an alternate winner may be selected in Sponsor’s sole discretion. In the event that a potential
        prize winner is disqualified for any reason, Sponsor reserves the right to award the prize to an alternate
        entrant who will also be selected randomly, even if the disqualified potential prize winner’s name has already
        been publicly announced. Sponsor is not responsible for any change of contact information of entrants. Unclaimed
        prize will not be awarded. The prize will be mailed within 30 days of the winner’s verification. Sponsor’s
        decisions are final and binding on all matters related to the Promotion.</p>

    <p><b>4. PRIZE</b></p>
    <p>the winner for each month during the Promotion Period will receive a $500 Living Spaces gift card, usable for

        Delivery of items purchased with the gift card
        may not be available in all areas. LIMIT OF ONE PRIZE PER EMAIL SUBSCRIBER. No substitution or cash equivalent
        of prizes are offered, and no transfer of a prize to a third party is permitted, except as determined by Sponsor
        in its sole discretion. Sponsor reserves the right to substitute a prize in whole or in part with one of equal
        or greater value. Federal, state, and/or local taxes (including any income taxes) and any other fees or costs
        associated with the prize are the sole responsibility of the winners regardless of whether the prize, in whole
        or in part, is used. Each winner’s use of his/her gift card is subject to the terms set forth thereon and/or
        determined by Sponsor. Winners must present the card at time of purchase and the total amount will be deducted
        until funds are depleted. The value of a gift card is not redeemable for cash unless required by law, or
        otherwise in Sponsor’s sole discretion. No replacement cards will be issued for lost or stolen gift cards.</p>

    <p><b>5. GENERAL CONDITIONS</b></p>
    <p>ANY ATTEMPT BY AN INDIVIDUAL TO DELIBERATELY DAMAGE ANY WEBSITE OR UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMATE OPERATION OF THIS
        PROMOTION IS A VIOLATION OF CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LAWS, AND SHOULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE MADE, SPONSOR RESERVES THE
        RIGHT TO SEEK DAMAGES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES) AND OTHER REMEDIES FROM ANY SUCH INDIVIDUAL TO THE FULLEST
        EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW INCLUDING CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.</p>

    <p><b>6. RELEASE OF LIABILITY</b></p>
    <p>By accepting the prize, winner agrees that the employees, contractors, directors, officers, and agents of
        Sponsor, its parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies, advertising, fulfillment, judging and promotion
        agencies will have no liability whatsoever for, and shall be held harmless by winner against, any liability for
        injuries, losses or damages of any kind to persons or property resulting in whole or in part, directly or
        indirectly, from participation in the Promotion, or from acceptance, possession, misuse or use of any prize.
        Sponsor is not responsible for incorrect or inaccurate entry information whether caused by Internet users or by
        any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the Promotion or by any technical or human
        error which may occur in the processing of the entries. Sponsor is not responsible for computer system, phone
        line, hardware, software or program malfunctions, or other errors, failures or delays in computer transmissions,
        email transmissions, or network connections that are human or technical in nature. Sponsor reserves the right,
        in its sole discretion to cancel or suspend this Promotion should fraud, virus, bugs or other causes beyond the
        control of Sponsor corrupt the administration, security or proper operation of the Promotion. In the event of
        cancellation, Sponsor will randomly award the remaining prizes from among all eligible, non-suspect entries
        received prior to cancellation.</p>
    <p>Entrants further understand and agree that all rights under Section 1542 of the Civil Code of California
        ("Section 1542") and any similar law of any state or territory of the United States that may be applicable with
        respect to the foregoing release are hereby expressly and forever waived. Entrants acknowledge that Section 1542
        provides that: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST
        IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY
        AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.” The releases hereunder are intended to apply to all claims not
        known or suspected to exist with the intent of waiving the effect of laws requiring the intent to release future
        unknown claims.</p>

    <p><b>7. PUBLICITY</b></p>
    <p>Except where prohibited by law, winner grants permission for Sponsor and those acting under its authority to not
        only use the uploaded photo but also his/her name, photograph(s), voice and/or likeness, for advertising and/or
        publicity purposes in any and all media now known or hereinafter invented without territorial or time
        limitations and without additional compensation.</p>

    <p><b>8. BINDING ARBITRATION</b></p>
    <p>You agree that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Promotion shall be settled by binding
        arbitration in a location determined by the arbitrator as set forth herein (provided that such location is
        reasonably convenient for you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties, in
        accordance with the applicable procedural rules set forth in the then prevailing Comprehensive Arbitration Rules
        and Procedures of JAMS (“JAMS Rules and Procedures”), and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s)
        may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The JAMS Rules and Procedures are available at
        www.jamsadr.com or by calling (800) 352-5267. The arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the JAMS Rules and
        Procedures. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court in accordance with the terms of this
        Agreement if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an
        individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the
        Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized
        at law. If you initiate arbitration against Sponsor, you will not be responsible for professional fees for the
        arbitrator’s services or any other JAMS fees. In the event that the claimant is able to demonstrate that the
        costs of arbitration will be cost-prohibitive or greater than the costs of litigation, Sponsor will pay as much
        of the claimant’s filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary
        to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive or more expensive than the cost of litigation. If any
        part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal (other than that claims
        will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis), or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures
        established by JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be
        construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were
        not contained herein. If, however, the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal is that claims
        will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall
        be null and void, and neither claimant nor Sponsor shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute. <b>THE
            ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A
            PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT
            CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED.</b></p>
    <p><b>BY AGREEING TO THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A
            JURY TRIAL AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL. DO NOT ENTER THIS PROMOTION IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE
            FOREGOING BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISIONS.</b></p>

    <p><b>9. GENERAL CONDITIONS</b></p>
    <p>Void outside of the states listed above and where prohibited. By participating, each entrant agrees to these
        Official Rules, and to the Sponsor’s decisions, which are final and binding in all respects. All issues and
        questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of these Official Rules, or
        the rights and obligations of entrant and Sponsor in connection with the Promotion, shall be governed by, and
        construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, U.S.A. without giving effect to the conflict
        of laws rules thereof, and any matters or proceedings which are not subject to arbitration as set forth in the
        preceding section of these Official Rules and/or for entering any judgment on an arbitration award, shall take
        place in Los Angeles County, California.</p>
