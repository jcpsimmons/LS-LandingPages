            <p><span class="bold-p">Access and Deletion Rights.</span>The CCPA provides California residents with
                specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and
                explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
            <p><i>Access to Information.</i> You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you
                about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and
                confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you. </li>
                <li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you. </li>
                <li>Our purposes for collecting that personal information. </li>
                <li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information. </li>
                <li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In accordance with the CCPA, we shall not provide you with your Social Security number, driver’s license
                number or other government-issued identification number, account number, health insurance or medical
                information number, account password or security questions and answers, in each case to the extent that
                we have such personal information about you. In addition, we may not provide you with specific pieces of
                personal information if the disclosure would create a substantial, articulable, and unreasonable risk to
                the security of that personal information</p>
            <p><i>Deletion Request. </i>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information
                that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your
                verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal
                information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
            <p>You should be aware that making a deletion request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal or
                deletion of personal information or content you may have posted. In addition, if you continue to
                interact with us, we will continue to collect information you share with us or we otherwise collect in
                connection with those interactions. </p>
            <p>Under the CCPA, we may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our
                service providers to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service
                    that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business
                    relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you. </li>
                <li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or
                    prosecute those responsible for such activities. </li>
                <li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality. </li>
                <li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or
                    exercise another right provided for by law. </li>
                <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act. </li>
                <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public
                    interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's
                    deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you
                    previously provided informed consent. </li>
                <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your
                    relationship with us. </li>
                <li>Comply with a legal obligation. </li>
                <li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in
                    which you provided it.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><i>Exercising Yout Access and Deletion Rights</i></p>
            <p>To exercise the access and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request
                to us by either:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Calling us at 866-241-6203.</li>
                <li>Visiting <a href="www.livingspaces.com/privacyrequest">www.livingspaces.com/privacyrequest</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable
                consumer request must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we
                    collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
                <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and
                    respond to it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your
                identity to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you (or an agent is unable
                to provide proof that the agent has been authorized by you).</p>
            <p>In connection with verifying your identity, we will request that you provide certain data points (e.g.,
                name, email address, phone number, address, etc.) so that we may match those with data points maintained
                by us (so that we may verify your identity with a reasonable degree, or in some cases depending on your
                request, with a reasonably high degree, of certainty). This will require us being able to match at least
                two data points and in many cases, including those requests for specific pieces of personal information,
                at least three data points provided by you with personal information maintained by us. Any request for
                specific pieces of information will also require that you declare under penalty of perjury that the
                request relates to you.</p>
            <p><i>Response Timing</i></p>
            <p>We shall confirm receipt of your request within 10 days of the request. We shall attempt to respond to a
                verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we
                will inform you of the extension period in accordance with the CCPA.</p>
            <p><i>Non-Discrimination. </i>We do not discriminate against consumers for exercising any of your CCPA
                rights.</p>
